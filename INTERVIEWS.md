#Interviews

Questions to ask potential users.

###Would people like to see:

- user profiles -- information about their classmates (maybe pulled from Facebook)
- preference ranking assistance (based on # of Facebook friends)
- solicitation email / Facebook message (invitation to use the service)
- filter by gender
- create a profile with NuProm, use your Facebook profile, or a combination of the two?
- how social? 
	- onsite messageboard
	- prom dresses / apparel planning
	- pool pictures after prom
	- pre / after - prom planning
	- integration corsage / boutennier services
		- maybe just charge these services to advertise on NuProm
	- *or just integrate these features with Facebook?*
- related advertisements / sponsorships or not?

###Other questions:

- would people like to use it for more than just prom? 
- how early do they want to know their date before the event?
- administered by the school? or independently? 
	- admin could add profiles / users to the system
		- or the admin could simply invite people to the event / site
	- or people have to individually add themselves
